# Licensing Note (Internal Demo)

This repository targets internal use only.

- PyMuPDF: licensed under AGPL/commercial. Internal use in your org is fine. If you later expose as a service to third parties or redistribute, you must either:
  - obtain a commercial license, or
  - replace PDF parsing with MIT/BSD alternatives (for example `pdfplumber` + `pdfminer.six`) and adjust table/image extraction accordingly.

Other listed dependencies are under permissive licenses commonly used in research/engineering demos. Always verify license compatibility before external distribution.
